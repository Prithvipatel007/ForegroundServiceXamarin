# ForegroundServiceXamarin

## This foreground Service demo app is implemented to be used from the Xamarin.Forms rather than Xamarin.Android. The Idea behind implementing this is to have a reference demo based on which anyone can redirect the Foreground service to xamarin.android via shared project.


> Note:
> This project was implemented just for Xamarin.Android. The implementation for Xamarin.IOS is not implemented and will not be implemented in the future. 
> Anyone can Use this project in any preferred way you want. There is no terms or conditions.
